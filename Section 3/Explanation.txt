Explanation : to optimize the query we had used indexing.

"CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_id ON orders(user_id);"

why indexing ?
because indexes are important for improving the performance of database queries,
especially those that involve filtering.
In this case we need an index on the user_id column because the query filters by user_id.
I we don't use indexing the database would have to check a full table.
